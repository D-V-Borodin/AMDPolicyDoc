To whom it may concern,

Following the Decennial IAEA Technical Meeting on Atomic, Molecular and Plasma-Material Interaction Data for Fusion Science and Technology which took place from 15 - 19 July 2024 (Helsinki, Finland), and the special subsequent Meeting
on Unified Atomic and Molecular Data Policies held on 25 - 27 Nov 2024 (Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany), the need was identified to agree on the procedure and criteria of the accepting/rating/checking of the various datasets providing
input to atomic and molecular data used in fusion applications. This obviously involves other related questions like data formats, data mining at various places, data synchronisation between those, etc.
Such discussions should involve data users such as the fusion plasma modelling community and diagnosticians using A7M data to interpret their measurements, as well as data providers.

A third meeting was held on 9-11 July at the IAEA Headquarters in Vienna under the auspices of the Global Network for Atomic & Molecular Physics of Plasmas to fninalize a proposal for A&M metadata that sould be used and uniquely identify
data sets within existing and new databases for standardized usage. The proposal includes a policy document as well as some examples of how the metadata information could be structured. This information is provided as the other files in
this repository.

We kind request your attention, collaboration and support in this endeavour. Please distribute it to any interested party within your institution so that they may comment and propose improvements to our proposal.

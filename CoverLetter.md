# Cover letter

To whom it may concern,

Following the Decennial IAEA Technical Meeting on Atomic, Molecular and Plasma-Material Interaction Data for Fusion Science and Technology which took place from 15 - 19 July 2024 (Helsinki, Finland), and the special subsequent Meeting on Unified Atomic and Molecular Data Policies held on 25 - 27 Nov 2024 (Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Germany), the need was identified to agree on the procedure and criteria of the accepting/rating checking of the various datasets providing input to atomic and molecular data used in fusion applications. This obviously involves other related questions like data formats, data mining at various places, data synchronisation between those, etc. Such discussions should involve data users such as the fusion plasma modelling community and diagnosticians using A&M data to interpret their measurements, as well as data providers.

A third meeting was held on 9-11 July at the IAEA Headquarters in Vienna under the auspices of the Global Network for Atomic & Molecular Physics of Plasmas to finalize a proposal for A&M metadata that should be used and uniquely identify data sets within existing and new databases for standardized usage. The proposal includes a policy document as well as some examples of how the metadata information could be structured. This information is provided as attachments to this letter.

We kindly request your attention, collaboration and support in this endeavour. Please distribute it to any interested party within your institution so that they may comment and suggest improvements to our proposal. After getting the feedback and clear consesus from the community we aim to seek support and participation from the stakeholders to implement this initiative in particular from ITER, EUROFusion, and IAEA and its networks.

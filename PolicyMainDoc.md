[TOC]

## Preamble

This document was started at the “Meeting on unified A&M data policies” in FZ Juelich (see https://indico.euro-fusion.org/event/3240/) with the continuation of the discussion supported by a dedicated IAEA TM  (see https://conferences.iaea.org/e/GNAMPP-3). It reflects the views of the informal researcher group formed during those meeting including indirect participants.
This document is a product of those discussions and joint effort approved by consensus between the main participants listed in section "Pariticipants".

## Participants

The following researches each with long experience of working (producing, utilizing in codes and experiments, validating etc.) have jointly developed and support the following document to be addressed to ITER, EUROfusion and IAEA so as to all fusion research community:

## Purpose of this document
This meeting brought together data users (i.e. people responsible for modelling codes) and data providers and aimed at identifying ways of improving the process of producing and managing atomic and molecular (A&M) and plasma-material interaction (PMI) data in fusion modelling codes.   The hope is that this document will trigger a broader response in the community in developing standards for data sharing.  The suggested standards are agnostic towards the codes that might use the data, data production and validation tools - we aim for aare aimed in commonly accepted, unified approach.   
The initiative group aims at reaching concreteconcreete goals in the interest of fundamental fusiuon research aims at reaching concrete goals in the interest of fundamental fusion research. We are open for broader cooperation and participation and count on support from ITER, EUROfusion and, in particular, the IAEA (as the initiative was triggered by the discussions at IAEA Ddecennial Mmeeting on A&M and PMSI data),
This meeting was triggered by discussions at the Decennial IAEA Technical Meeting on Atomic, Molecular and Plasma-Material Interaction Data for Fusion Science and Technology 2024 (AMPMI 2024) held at the University of Helsinki, Finland and aims at reaching concrete goals in the interest of fundamental fusion research. 


## Executive summary

The meeting has triggered a creation of informal initiative group which proposes 2 documents for consideration:
1)	Policy document - “Best practices”  regarding the joint work on A&M data to be applied at least to owun work first,  but later on (after reaching maturity by that experience) can be suggested for a broader use.
2)	Proposal for next steps to be undertaken in the interest of joint development of A&M data bases, CRMs and related entrees to the fusion codes. 
The initial draft of the documents formulated, the work should continue after the meeting. 
We aim to seek more solid support from… 
We aim at developing a procedure to assess and recommend for use in fusion modelling the datasets (including validatiion, other quality assesment, adequate resolution and format).
